Safety First!

My capstone project for Data Analytics Evening Cohort 3 at Nashville Software School in which I take a look at data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Using Python and Tableau, I examine whether we are safer in the US in the age of high speed internet, iPhones, and Google than we were in the shadow of Y2K. I also take a look at changes in emergency room visits by product category from 2014 to 2019 to see if there are any products that may be in need of a safety campaign. Finally, I created a connected dashboard which allows a user to easily find the incident reports for each product category and filter them by age, sex, and alcohol involvement.

I hope that you will find the data as interesting as I did. Be careful with the connected dashboard; it's easy to lose half an hour.
